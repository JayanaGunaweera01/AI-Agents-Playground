# ðŸ¤– AI Agents Playground

A collection of modular, open-source **AI agents** built for experimentation, automation, and collaboration.  
Each agent is designed to handle specific tasks â€” from data analysis and creative writing to autonomous decision-making.  

> ðŸ’¡ Whether you're building your own agent, improving an existing one, or just exploring, youâ€™re welcome here!


## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains multiple **AI agents** implemented in Python.  
Each agent is designed with **extensibility and modularity** in mind â€” you can add tools, modify behaviors, or create new personalities.

Example use cases:
- Autonomous research and summarization  
- Chat and task automation  
- Coding assistants and data explorers  
- Multi-agent collaboration frameworks
